Global tasks are useful for performing periodic actions like updating cached data, performing cleanup actions or other housekeeping tasks, while periodic callbacks should be reserved for making periodic updates to an application.\n",

    "The different contexts in which global tasks and periodic callbacks run also has implications on how they should be scheduled. Scheduled task **must not** be declared in the application code itself, i.e. if you are serving `panel serve app.py` the callback you are scheduling must not be declared in the `app.py`. It must be defined in an external module or in a separate script declared as part of the `panel serve` invocation using the `--setup` commandline argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scheduling using `pn.state.schedule_task` is idempotent, i.e. if a callback has already been scheduled under the same name subsequent calls will have no effect. By default the starting time is immediate but may be overridden with the `at` keyword argument. The period may be declared using the `period` argument or a cron expression (which requires the `croniter` library). Note that the `at` time should be in local time but if a callable is provided it must return a UTC time. If `croniter` is installed a `cron` expression can be provided using the `cron` argument.\n",

We will create a widget without populating its options, then we will add an `onload` callback, which will set the options once the initial page is loaded. Imagine for example that we have to fetch the options from some database which might take a little while, by deferring the loading of the options to the callback we can get something on the screen as quickly as possible and only run the expensive callback when we have already rendered something for the user to look at."
